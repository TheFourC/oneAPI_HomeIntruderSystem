# AI-Driven Home Security System with oneAPI Integration 🏡🤖

## Overview

Welcome to our AI-driven home security system project, empowered by Intel's oneAPI toolkit. This project represents an innovative approach to enhance home security using artificial intelligence while harnessing the capabilities of oneAPI. Our primary goal is to create a smart and efficient home security system that leverages oneAPI's versatility for optimized performance.

## Key Components

### Integration of oneAPI Toolkit 🧰🔧

We utilize Intel's oneAPI toolkit to maximize the potential of available hardware resources, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. This integration allows us to optimize the performance of our AI components for real-time monitoring and analysis.

### Machine Learning for Intruder Detection 🧠🚨

We implement machine learning models, leveraging oneAPI's support for hardware accelerators, to detect intruders and unusual activities. The AI models adapt to evolving conditions and make real-time decisions for enhanced security. Integration of Intel oneDNN accelerates deep learning model inference for superior performance.

### Facial Recognition and Object Identification 👤🔍

With the power of oneAPI, we incorporate facial recognition capabilities even when faces are not clearly visible. Additionally, our system can identify potential weapons, adding an extra layer of security. Intel oneMKL is used for efficient mathematical computations during recognition.

### Real-time Monitoring and Alert Generation 🔄📢

Our system integrates insights from machine learning models and utilizes oneTBB for efficient multithreading to enable real-time monitoring and alert generation. This ensures that homeowners receive instant notifications through the Telegram messaging platform.

### User Interface for System Monitoring 🖥️📱

We are developing a user-friendly dashboard that allows homeowners to monitor the security system's status and view real-time alerts. This interface simplifies user interaction and oversight.

## Our Vision 👁️

Our project aims to revolutionize home security by integrating artificial intelligence and oneAPI's optimization capabilities. We strive to provide homeowners with an intelligent and proactive security solution that adapts to various situations, ensuring the safety of their homes.

Stay tuned for updates on our project's progress, or feel free to get involved and contribute to the future of AI-powered home security systems, enhanced by oneAPI.
